/**
 * Merged tool-call row — the shadowed `tool.call.toolview` registrant.
 *
 * For the first call of a consecutive run of grouped tools, renders the run as
 * one card (the first call's full row) plus one compact child row per
 * continuation call. For a continuation call, renders nothing: the seat stays
 * empty and the injected stylesheet collapses it out of the flow. When the
 * call is not a chat tool-call node at all (e.g. dispatched as a subcall),
 * falls back to a plain single row so the call never disappears.
 *
 * The row surface mirrors the built-in generic ToolRow: a variant title/icon
 * plus the settled card (read/search/diff/terminal/web) or IN/OUT text. The
 * card primitives' localized label props are built here from the plugin's own
 * dictionary (the primitives are cordis-free and require complete labels).
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of the chat snapshot + the frozen call
 * slices (replay-deterministic); expand state is component-local view state.
 * @module
