 *    tool-call node (e.g. a read dispatched as a subcall). The node key
 *    format stays a ui-conversation internal, so the seat finds itself by
 *    scanning the store for the tool-call node owning its call id instead of
 *    recomputing the key.
 * 2. Walks backward/forward to the maximal consecutive run containing it. A
 *    call continues the run when it is a grouped tool AND same-tool-same-run:
 *    the identical wire name, or a sibling of the same known variant family
 *    (grep+glob, bash+pwsh, read+web_fetch…). Unknown names (variant
 *    `others`) only merge with themselves, so unrelated tools never share a
 *    card (`adjacent`: any consecutive run; `step`: same agent step as this
 *    call).
 * 3. Partitions the run into `maxGroupSize`-sized groups; this call is the
 *    group's first only when it heads one of those partitions. Truncation
 *    therefore never orphans a call: the excess starts its own group.
 *
 * @param order - chat node key order.
 * @param nodes - chat node store.
 * @param myCallId - the call id of the seat asking about itself.
 * @param tools - grouped wire tool names; empty means every tool.
 * @param groupBy - grouping mode.
 * @param maxGroupSize - per-group cap.
 * @returns the group partition, or null when the call is not a chat tool-call node.
