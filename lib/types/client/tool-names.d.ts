/**
 * The built-in tool universe this plugin shadows by default, plus the
 * variant-classification vocabulary mirroring ui-tool's tool-call model.
 *
 * The keyed `tool.call.toolview` slot dispatches on the exact wire tool name,
 * so a shadowed registration is needed per name (there is no wildcard). This
 * list names every shipped tool whose row belongs to the generic ToolRow
 * family — a variant title/icon plus read/search/diff/terminal/web card or
 * IN/OUT text — which the merged row reproduces faithfully.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded: tools with custom row cards this plugin does not
 * replicate (`skill`, `todo_write` / `ask_user_question` whose summary
 * formatting is tool-specific, and the read-only Cordis inspection verbs
 * `cordis_inspect_list` / `cordis_inspect_query` / `cordis_inspect_self`,
 * which render through ui-tool's own details row). They keep their built-in
 * rows unless the user names them in the `tools` config explicitly.
 *
 * The former dynamic Cordis verbs (`cordis_define`, `cordis_run`,
 * `cordis_stop`, `cordis_undefine`, `cordis_inspect_self`) and their
 * `cordis_package_inspect` / `cordis_runtime_inspect` inspection siblings no
 * longer exist on the wire at 0.1.7-rc.1 (`tool-cordis` was narrowed to
 * read-only inspection), so they are not listed here.
